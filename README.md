# Robotic-Laser-Hand Side Project:

                                                                         
My goal is to create a robotic hand that angles itself using the servo motor and the joystick. I will attach a laser to this hand and simulate a robotic hand moving. This project will be done by me in stages. 

- **STAGE 1 (2021-06-03):**
I created the circuit and coded the necessary software to begin the process of flashing the laser via a joystick. This process will be the initial step and the software for this is uploaded in this repository. In the next stage, I will begin attaching the servo motor to the circuit and update the software.

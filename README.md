# Robotic-Laser-Hand Side Project:

                                                                         
My goal is to create a robotic hand that angles itself using the servo motor and the joystick. I will attach a laser to this hand and simulate a robotic hand moving. This project will be done by me in stages. 

- ## **STAGE 1 (2021-06-03):**
I created the circuit and coded the necessary software to begin the process of flashing the laser via a joystick. This process will be the initial step and the software for this is uploaded in this repository. In the next stage, I will begin attaching the servo motor to the circuit and update the software.

- ## **STAGE 2 (2021-06-11):**
I added the servo motor to the circuit and created the necessary changes to the software to accomodate for the motor. The motor is controlled by the joystick. I created a prototype by taping the laser to the servo motor to simulate movement. The movement is restricted to horizontal movement for now. In the next stage, I will try attaching another servo motor to account for the vertical movement.

- ## **STAGE 3 (2021-06-29):**
I added a new servo motor, and I made minor changes to the software to accommodate for the vertical motion created by it. In the next stage, I will begin attaching the two servo motors together so that the laser has both horizontal and vertical movement.
